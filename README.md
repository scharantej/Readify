## Flask Application Design for a Book Summaries Website

### HTML Files

**home.html**: This file will serve as the homepage of the website, displaying a welcome message with links to various book summaries.

**[book-summary-name].html**: Multiple HTML files will be created, each dedicated to a specific book summary. These files will contain the summary of the book, including its title, author, and key points.

### Routes

**@app.route('/')**: This route will handle the homepage and return the `home.html` file.

**@app.route('/<book_summary_name>'):**: This route will accept a book summary name as a parameter and serve the corresponding HTML file, displaying the summary of that book.
